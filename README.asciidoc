= About This code

Concurrency is an important issue, in Android.
This repository contains four separate projects,
each of which shows one way of managing concurrent tasks.

== Setup

Each of the projects has the two meta-data files necessary to create an Eclipse project,
in the directory: $PROJ/tools/ide/eclipse.  You can create an Eclipse project from a *nix
command line, like this:

----
> cd $PROJ
> cp tools/ide/eclipse/project .project
> cp tools/ide/eclipse/classpath .classpath
----

Note that the file names do not have initial periods ('.') in the tools directory,
but require them, in the root directory, to be recognized by Eclipse

== Projects

=== Naive

This example simple presents the problem: making a request of a network service.

It is naive and broken.

=== AsyncTask

This example demonstrates the use of an AsyncTask to move the network request to a non-UI thread.
 
=== Unbound Service

This example demonstrates the use of an IntentService as a way of managing asynchronous tasks.
 
=== Bound Service

This example demonstrates a bound Looper/Handler as a way of managing asynchronous tasks.
